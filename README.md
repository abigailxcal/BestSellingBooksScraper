Chromedriver must be installed on your local machine for the scraper to work. To do that, open up your terminal and install homebrew, then type in 
'brew install --cask chromedriver'. Ensure the path to chromedriver is in '/opt/homebrew/bin/chromedriver, otherwise change PATH_TO_DRIVER in main.py to the path of your chromedriver.
